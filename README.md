# Stock_price_prediction_system
 In this Project, we are going to predict the stock price for a stock using its historical data. The solution involves training a LSTM network on historical data and using it to forecast the future prices of the stocks.

LSTMs or Long Short Term Memory is handy for dealing with time series data and stock market prices can also be classified into it. The approach we used was sliding window approach for creating the dataset out of the csv file. Then we defined the model with one lstm and one single fully connected layer at the end. We then trained the network, end to end and got the prediction.
